Voyant:

-	Text Analysis =  
     - Collect texts. Look for patterns. Find relationships. Interpret the meaning of what you find. Wider significance.
-	“Gateway drug to the digital humanities”
-	Voyant encourages us to zoom in and out, looking at the very broad macroscopic and then jump into the micro, and back again. Each tool panel in Voyant can be embedded into a new document, so that you can share what you find, or so that you can write an argument and your readers can explore your data at the same time.
-	Work with pasted text, urls or downloaded stuff
-	High frequency terms, how they vary, patterns
-	Corpus = https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=039bc7a0ba01ab748b0e14225cb3ebf9
-	This is so freaking cool
-	Heroic Lone Scholars = so true, why waste time trying to have an original thought
- One way to think about how you can study a text is to think about entering into a conversation with the text through Voyant. Think about questions you might ask about the text like:
•	What is this about? What words would I expect to see as describing the text?
•	What does this text say about something that matters to me like “friendship”?
•	What words in the Cirrus word cloud make sense, and what words are anomalous?
•	How does the language of the text change over the span of the text? Are some words more important in the beginning and some at the end? Could there be framing words?
-	Terms = same info but this time represented as a table with counts of the number of times the word appears and a ‘spark line’ graph showing roughly where the term is most prominent
